# Free Car Parking Space Detection Using OpenCV

## Introduction
In urban areas, finding available parking spaces is often a time-consuming and frustrating task for drivers. To ease the problem, this project aims to develop a computer vision-based solution to detect free car parking spaces in a parking lot. By using OpenCV, the system will process real-time video streams of a parking lot and identify vacant spots, providing an efficient and automated approach to parking management.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a real-time system that: 

•	Detects available parking spaces in a parking lot using OpenCV. 
•	Analyzes video stream captured by camera placed strategically around the parking lot. 
•	Provides visual output highlighting free spaces and occupied spaces.
•	Displays free parking count on screen.

## Tools and Technologies: 
- Programming Language: Python 
- Integrated Development Environment: PyCharm 
- Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV, CVZone

This project will contribute towards an efficient and automated parking management solution by using computer vision techniques. With OpenCV's powerful image processing capabilities, the system will provide real-time detection of free parking spaces, reducing driver frustration and improving parking lot efficiency.
